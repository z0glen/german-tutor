A website to help manage words learned in a new language (namely German).

## Inspiration
When I was learning German while living in Germany, I wanted to keep track of words and phrases that I encountered 
while going about my daily life. I started using simple flashcards, but I realized that it would be helpful to keep
track of where I saw things, what the context was, if I saw it repeatedly or heard different translations. 
There was way too much data for me to use a flashcard, so I decided to start working on my own way to keep track of
all this. It turned out to be helpful for me- I could make fields for any words that I saw, while adding as many fields
as I needed. 

## Future Directions
There are many, many more ideas on how to improve this. Most notably, I would like to edit words after submission, 
add more options for practicing (fill in the blanks, article tests), and I would like to integrate a translator, 
so that I can enter words without also looking up the translation.
